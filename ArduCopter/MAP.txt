1. Complete Rotation mapping and understand transforms so that without streaming we shud still be able to get the roll pitch yaw that is onboard of quadcopter:

2. Stream RADIO_IN values to see the radio raw values. How calibration will change them etc. 

3. Writing a Landing protocol just based on Altitude and Stabilize modes from RAW Data and RC_Override

4. Writing a Roll Pitch controller to move to a position using mocap data.
